      <h2>Are You Feeling Suicidal ?</h2>
      <p>
        Even though your pain may seem overwhelming and permanent at the moment, there are ways to deal with suicidal thoughts and feelings and overcome the pain.
      </p>
      <h2>I’m having suicidal thoughts, what do I need to know ?</h2>
      <p>
        No matter how much pain you’re experiencing right now, you’re not alone. Many of us have had suicidal thoughts at some point in our lives. Feeling suicidal is not a character defect, and it doesn’t mean that you are crazy, or weak, or flawed. It only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. But with time and support, you can overcome your problems and the pain and suicidal feelings will pass.
        <br/><br/>
        Some of the finest, most admired, needed, and talented people have been where you are now. Many of us have thought about taking our own lives when we’ve felt overwhelmed by depression and devoid of all hope. But the pain of depression can be treated and hope can be renewed. No matter what your situation, there are people who need you, places where you can make a difference, and experiences that can remind you that life is worth living. It takes real courage to face death and step back from the brink. You can use that courage to face life, to learn coping skills for overcoming depression, and for finding the strength to keep going.
      </p>
      <h3>Remember:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Your emotions are not fixed – they are constantly changing. How you feel today may not be the same as how you felt yesterday or how you’ll feel tomorrow or next week.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your absence would create grief and anguish in the lives of friends and loved ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are many things you can still accomplish in your life.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are sights, sounds, and experiences in life that have the ability to delight and lift you – and that you would miss.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your ability to experience pleasurable emotions is equal to your ability to experience distressing emotions.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>How to cope with suicidal thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Remember that while it may seem as if these suicidal thoughts and feelings will never end, this is never a permanent condition. You WILL feel better again. In the meantime, there are some ways to help cope with your suicidal thoughts and feelings.
      </p>
      <h3>If You Have Suicidal Thoughts and Feelings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Things to do :</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Talk with someone every day, preferably face to face.</span> Though you feel like withdrawing, ask trusted friends and acquaintances to spend time with you. Or continue to call a crisis helpline and talk about your feelings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Make a safety plan.</span> Develop a set of steps that you can follow during a suicidal crisis. It should include contact numbers for your doctor or therapist, as well as friends and family members who will help in an emergency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Make a written schedule</span> for yourself every day and stick to it, no matter what. Keep a regular routine as much as possible, even when your feelings seem out of control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Get out in the sun</span> or into nature for at least 30 minutes a day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Exercise</span> as vigorously as is safe for you. To get the most benefit, aim for 30 minutes of exercise per day. But you can start small. Three 10-minute bursts of activity can have a positive effect on mood.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Make time for things that bring you joy.</span> Even if very few things bring you pleasure at the moment, force yourself to do the things you used to enjoy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Remember your personal goals.</span> You may have always wanted to travel to a particular place, read a specific book, own a pet, move to another place, learn a new hobby, volunteer, go back to school, or start a family. Write your personal goals down.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <li>Things to avoid :</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Being alone.</span> Solitude can make suicidal thoughts even worse. Visit a friend, or family member, or pick up the phone and call a crisis helpline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Alcohol and drugs.</span> Drugs and alcohol can increase depression, hamper your problem-solving ability, and can make you act impulsively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Doing things that make you feel worse.</span> Listening to sad music, looking at certain photographs, reading old letters, or visiting a loved one’s grave can all increase negative feelings.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>Recovering from suicidal thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Even if your suicidal thoughts and feelings have subsided, get help for yourself. Experiencing that sort of emotional pain is itself a traumatizing experience. Finding a support group or therapist can be very helpful in decreasing the chances that you will feel suicidal again in the future.
      </p>
      <h3>5 steps to recovery</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>Identify triggers or situations</span> that lead to feelings of despair or generate suicidal thoughts, such as an anniversary of a loss, alcohol, or stress from relationships. Find ways to avoid these places, people, or situations.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
          <span>Take care of yourself.</span> Eat right, don’t skip meals, and get plenty of sleep. Exercise is also key: it releases endorphins, relieves stress, and promotes emotional well-being.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
          <span>Build your support network.</span> Surround yourself with positive influences and people who make you feel good about yourself. The more you’re invested in other people and your community, the more you have to lose—which will help you stay positive and on the recovery track.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
          <span>Develop new activities and interests.</span> Find new hobbies, volunteer activities, or work that gives you a sense of meaning and purpose. When you’re doing things you find fulfilling, you’ll feel better about yourself and feelings of despair are less likely to return.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
          <span>Learn to deal with stress in a healthy way.</span> Find healthy ways to keep your stress levels in check, including exercising, meditating, using sensory strategies to relax, practicing simple breathing exercises, and challenging self-defeating thoughts.
        </li>
      </ol>
